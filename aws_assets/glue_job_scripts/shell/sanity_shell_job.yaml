# WARNING: This is experimental
# Based on recent discussion, lets not use .yaml based definitions.
# Instead use cdk construct to define the job definitions
#
# Keeping for reference only.
#
# Define the Glue shell job definition here. This file is read by the
# Cloud formation deployment script to create job definition"
#
# It is perfectly fine to create two different jobs which are using the
# same script. For defining the multiple jobs you can use YAML document
# marker to separate them as shown below.
#
# Other Considerations: It is assumed that if you are going to define
# two or more jobs using same shell script, they would be related closely
# enough that their change would requires review together.
